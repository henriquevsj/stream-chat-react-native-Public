## Owasp Zap
As said in read.me, the analyzes carried out by Owasp Zap were not successful, as the application did not perform when the device was connected to the Owasp Zap proxy, 
I still uploaded what was captured and the automatic intrusion tests that were carried out, being used:

- Real-time analysis of the application
- Active Scan
- Ajax Spider
